In this paper we attempt to create a robust of the record(OTR) chat
service utilizing asymetric and symetric encryption standards. That
aims to provide confidentiallity/security and privacy for it's
clients. A risk analysis is preformed to esure that our planned
application does not have any obvious faults or backdoors. We porpose an
implementation done in the Rust programming language which lets us
get the speed of a low level language but has automatic memory
management. The symmetric key exchange is handled by the server where
after the clients can communicate with asymmetric RSA encrypted data.
This leads to a much more secure/private and confidental chat solution.

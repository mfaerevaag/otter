\subsection{Running the application}
The application is Rust, and therefore requires the {\tt rustc}
compiler (v1.13.0) and {\tt cargo} build system (v0.14.0).

The application contains two binaries; one for the server and one for
the client, named as such.

Firstly, from the root directory, start the server with {\tt cargo run
  --bin server}. The output should look like the following
\begin{verbatim}
   Compiling otter-ws-rs v0.1.0 (file:///home/markus/dev/code/fts/otter-ws-rs)
    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 3.38 secs
     Running `target/debug/server`
listening to 127.0.0.1:10000...
\end{verbatim}

Now, a client can be started from the directory with {\tt cargo run
  --bin client}. The output should look like the following
\begin{verbatim}
TODO
\end{verbatim}
